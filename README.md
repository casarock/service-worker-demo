# Service Worker Demo
This repository contains my Service Worker Demo for my Talk "Always on, or not?".

Entry page is "webpage.html".

The Demo contains 2 branches beside master branch:

1. master: plain Service Worker registration
2. [offline_fallback](https://github.com/casarock/service-worker-demo/tree/offline_fallback): Register SW and cache a dedicated offline fallback page.
3. [cache](https://github.com/casarock/service-worker-demo/tree/cache): Register SW and add a cache which updates itself + offline fallback page.
